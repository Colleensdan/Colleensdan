# Hello, Iâ€™m Colleen! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Iâ€™m a developer with a keen interest in **Artificial Intelligence**, **psychology** and **innovation**. I love exploring the intersection of technology and human behaviour, and Iâ€™m always on the lookout for exciting projects and collaborations.

## About Me

**What I Do:**
  
  I design and implement projects that harness the power of AI to address complex challengesâ€”from natural language processing to predictive modellingâ€”and I explore how insights from psychology can drive innovation in technology.

## Projects & Contributions

Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of projects ranging from detecting biomarkers implicated in early stage Huntington's disease, to a sentiment analysis chatbot. Feel free to explore my repositories for more details on how I combine technical skills with creative problem-solving.
